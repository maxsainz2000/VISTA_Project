# MerchSys.App — Services

This page details the Service implementations specifically located within the **MerchSys.App** module (Composition Root). These typically include services with direct WPF or host dependencies.

## Infrastructure & UI Services

| File Path | Interface & Implementation | Key Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| `src/MerchSys.App/Services/WpfLowStockNotifier.vb` | `ILowStockNotifier`<br>`WpfLowStockNotifier` | WPF-specific implementation for low-stock alerts. Uses `Notification.Wpf`'s `NotificationManager` to display desktop toast notifications. Lives in the App layer to prevent WPF dependencies in the Inventory library. |
